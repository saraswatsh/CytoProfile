# Error-bar Plot

This function generates an error-bar plot to visually compare different
groups against a designated baseline group. It displays the central
tendency (mean or median) as a bar and overlays error bars to represent
the data's spread (e.g., standard deviation, MAD, or standard error).
The plot can also include p-value and effect size labels (based on
SSMD), presented either as symbols or numeric values, to highlight
significant differences and the magnitude of effects. When an output
filename is provided the plot is saved to disk; otherwise the ggplot
object is returned and drawn on the current graphics device.

## Usage

``` r
cyt_errbp(
  data,
  group_col = NULL,
  p_lab = TRUE,
  es_lab = TRUE,
  class_symbol = FALSE,
  x_lab = "",
  y_lab = "",
  title = "",
  stat = c("mean", "median"),
  error = c("se", "sd", "mad", "ci"),
  scale = c("none", "log2", "log10", "zscore", "custom"),
  custom_fn = NULL,
  method = c("auto", "ttest", "wilcox"),
  p_adjust_method = NULL,
  output_file = NULL,
  label_size = 4
)
```

## Arguments

- data:

  A data frame containing at least one numeric column and a grouping
  column.

- group_col:

  Character string naming the column that defines groups. This column
  will be coerced to a factor.

- p_lab:

  Logical. If `TRUE` (default) p‑value labels are displayed for group
  comparisons.

- es_lab:

  Logical. If `TRUE` (default) effect‑size labels are displayed.

- class_symbol:

  Logical. If `TRUE`, p‑value and effect‑size labels are encoded using
  symbols (e.g., `*`, `>>>`). If `FALSE`(default), numeric values are
  shown instead.

- x_lab:

  Character string for the x-axis label. If empty a default label is
  generated.

- y_lab:

  Character string for the y-axis label. If empty a default label is
  generated.

- title:

  Character string for the plot title. If empty a default title is
  generated.

- stat:

  Character. Central tendency statistic to use. Choices are "mean" or
  "median"; default is "mean". Added to support non‑mean summaries.

- error:

  Character. Error measure visualized around the statistic. Options are
  "se" (standard error; default), "sd" (standard deviation), "mad"
  (median absolute deviation) or "ci" (approximate 95 % confidence
  interval).

- scale:

  Character controlling data transformation before analysis. Accepts
  "none" (default), "log2", "log10", "zscore" or "custom".

- custom_fn:

  A user‑supplied function applied to numeric columns when
  `scale = "custom"`.

- method:

  Character controlling the statistical test used for pairwise
  comparisons. Options are "auto" (default; choose between t‑test and
  Wilcoxon based on a normality test), "ttest" or "wilcox".

- p_adjust_method:

  Character. If non‑NULL, specifies the method used by
  [`p.adjust()`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/p.adjust.html) to correct
  p‑values across all comparisons (e.g., "BH" for Benjamini–Hochberg).
  If `NULL` (default) no adjustment is performed.

- output_file:

  Optional file path. If provided, the plot is saved using `ggsave()`;
  otherwise the plot is returned and automatically printed.

- label_size:

  Numeric. Font size for p‑value and effect‑size labels. Default is 4.

## Value

An error-bar plot (a `ggplot` object) is produced and optionally saved
as a PDF. If `output_file` is specified, the function returns returns
the `ggplot` object.

## Examples

``` r
# Basic usage with default settings
df <- ExampleData1[, c("Group", "CCL-20/MIP-3A", "IL-10")]
cyt_errbp(df, group_col = "Group")

# Use mean and SD, log2 transform and show significance
cyt_errbp(df, group_col = "Group", stat = "mean", error = "sd",
          scale = "log2", class_symbol = TRUE, method = "ttest")
```
