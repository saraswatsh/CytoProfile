Description: CytoProfile is a comprehensive tool for cytokine profiling analysis. 
  It supports quality control using biologically meaningful cutoffs on raw cytokine 
  measurements and tests for distributional symmetry to suggest appropriate transformations. 
  The package offers exploratory data analysis with summary statistics, enhanced boxplots, and 
  barplots, along with both univariate and multivariate analysis capabilities for in-depth cytokine profiling.
