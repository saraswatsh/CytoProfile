\title{ANOVA Analysis on Continuous Variables.}
\usage{
cyt_anova(data)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame or matrix containing both categorical and
continuous variables. Character columns will be converted to factors and
used as predictors, while numeric columns will be used as continuous outcomes.}
}
\value{
A list of adjusted p-values from Tukey's HSD tests for each
combination of continuous outcome and categorical predictor. List
elements are named in the format "outcome_predictor".
}
\description{
This function performs an analysis of variance (ANOVA) for each continuous
variable against every categorical predictor in the input data. Character
columns are automatically converted to factors; all factor columns are used
as predictors while numeric columns are used as continuous outcomes.
For each valid predictor (i.e., with more than one level and no more
than 10 levels), Tukey's Honest Significant Difference (HSD) test is
conducted and the adjusted p-values for pairwise comparisons are extracted.

\examples{
# Loading data
data("ExampleData1")
# Perform ANOVA on selected columns of the cytodata dataset
anova_results <- cyt_anova(ExampleData1[, c(1:2, 5:6)])
print(anova_results)
