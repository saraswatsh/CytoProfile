\title{ANOVA analysis on all continuous variables within the data.}
\usage{
cyt.anova(x.df)
}
\arguments{
\item{x.df}{A data frame or matrix containing both categorical and continuous variables.
Character columns are converted to factors; all factor columns are used as predictors,
while numeric columns are used as continuous outcomes.}
}
\value{
A list of adjusted p-values from Tukey's HSD tests for each combination of continuous outcome
and categorical predictor. The list elements are named in the format "outcome_predictor".
}
\description{
This function performs an ANOVA for each continuous variable against every categorical predictor
in the input data. For each valid predictor (i.e., with more than one level and no more than 10 levels),
it conducts Tukey's HSD test and extracts the adjusted p-values for pairwise comparisons.
