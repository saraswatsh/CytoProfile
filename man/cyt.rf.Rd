\title{Run Random Forest Classification on Cytokine Data}
\usage{
cyt.rf(
  data,
  group_col,
  ntree = 500,
  mtry = 5,
  train_fraction = 0.7,
  plot_roc = TRUE,
  k_folds = 5,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing the cytokine data, with one column as the grouping variable and the rest as numerical features.}

\item{group_col}{A string representing the name of the column with the grouping variable (i.e., the target variable for classification).}

\item{ntree}{An integer specifying the number of trees to grow in the forest (default is 500).}

\item{mtry}{An integer specifying the number of variables randomly selected at each split (default is 5).}

\item{train_fraction}{A numeric value between 0 and 1 representing the proportion of data to use for training (default is 0.7).}

\item{plot_roc}{A logical value indicating whether to plot the ROC curve and calculate the AUC for binary classification (default is TRUE).}

\item{k_folds}{An integer specifying the number of folds for cross-validation (default is 5).}

\item{step}{A numeric value specifying the fraction of variables to remove at each step during cross-validation for feature selection (default is 0.5).}

\item{run_rfcv}{A logical value indicating whether to run Random Forest cross-validation for feature selection (default is TRUE).}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\item{model}{The trained Random Forest model.}
\item{confusion_matrix}{The confusion matrix of the test set predictions.}
\item{importance_plot}{A ggplot object showing the variable importance plot based on Mean Decrease Gini.}
\item{rfcv_result}{Results from Random Forest cross-validation for feature selection (if \code{run_rfcv} is TRUE).}
\item{importance_data}{A data frame containing the variable importance based on the Gini index.}
}
\description{
This function trains and evaluates a Random Forest classification model on cytokine data.
It includes feature importance visualization, cross-validation for feature selection, and performance metrics like accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity.
Optionally, for binary classification, the function also plots the ROC curve and calculates the AUC.
}
\details{
The function fits a Random Forest model to the provided data, splitting it into training and test sets.
It calculates key performance metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity for both the training and test sets.
For binary classification tasks, it can also plot the ROC curve and calculate the AUC.
If \code{run_rfcv} is set to TRUE, Random Forest cross-validation is performed to identify the optimal number of features for classification.
