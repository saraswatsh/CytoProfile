\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing numeric variables and a
grouping column.}

\item{group_col}{Character.  Name of the grouping column.}

\item{cond1}{Character strings specifying the levels of
\code{group_col} to compare.  If either is \code{NULL}, all pairwise
combinations of conditions are used.}

\item{cond2}{Character strings specifying the levels of
\code{group_col} to compare.  If either is \code{NULL}, all pairwise
combinations of conditions are used.}

\item{fold_change_thresh}{Numeric.  Threshold for absolute fold
change (in original scale).  Default is 2.}

\item{p_value_thresh}{Numeric.  Threshold for the p‑value (raw or
adjusted).  Default is 0.05.}

\item{top_labels}{Integer.  Number of top points to label in each
plot.  Default is 10.}

\item{method}{Character.  Statistical test to use.  "ttest" (default)
uses two‑sample t‑tests; "wilcox" uses Wilcoxon rank‑sum tests.}

\item{p_adjust_method}{Character or \code{NULL}.  Method to adjust
p‑values across variables within each comparison (e.g., "BH").
If \code{NULL} (default) no adjustment is performed. See \code{\link[stats]{p.adjust}}
for details.}

\item{add_effect}{Logical.  If \code{TRUE}, effect sizes are computed and
returned in the results (Cohen's d for t‑tests; rank‑biserial for
Wilcoxon).  Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{verbose}{Logical.  If \code{TRUE}, prints the data frame used for
the final comparison without the label column.  Default is
\code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
A list of ggplot objects (one per comparison).  Each plot
visualizes log2 fold change on the x‑axis and –log10 of the
(adjusted) p‑value on the y‑axis.  The underlying data used to
construct the final plot are printed when \code{verbose = TRUE}.
}
\description{
This function subsets the numeric columns from the input data
and compares them based on a selected grouping column. It computes the fold
changes (as the ratio of means) and associated p-values for each numeric variable
between two groups. The results are log2-transformed (for fold change) and
-log10-transformed (for p-values) to generate a volcano plot. Additionally,
there is a choice between t‑tests and Wilcoxon rank‑sum tests and adjusting
p‑values for multiple comparisons
}
\note{
If \code{cond1} and \code{cond2} are not provided, the function
automatically generates all possible pairwise combinations of groups from
the specified \code{group_col} for comparisons.
